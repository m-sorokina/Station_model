Required:
station model which have fuel, cargo and people capacity
when new vehicle arrives it is needed to check
if the possibility of station in every type of capacity is not exhausted
and the station could to accept the vehicle
buses and trucks arrive in random order and contain random load and people volume
every time when vehicle arrives:
 - check if station capacities are not exhausted
    - fuel capacity
    - people capacity
    - cargo capacity
  then
 - truck: unload cargo
          increase cargo volume at the station
 - bus: people leave the bus
        increase people value at the station
every time when vehicle leave the station :
  - truck: take the fuel to full tank
           take the cargo in random volume but not greater than its capacity
  - bus: take the fuel to full tank
           take people in random value but not greater than its capacity


station:
fuel capacity
fuel volume available
cargo capacity
cargo volume available
people capacity
people volume available

abstract vehicle:
- brand?:
  - tank capacity
  - fuel volume
- people
- add fuel
- get fuel

interface Changes? find functional interface?
 - unload (people, load)
 - load (people, load)

v/i ----> *truck*:
  - load capacity
  - goods volume
v/i ----> *bus*
  - people capacity
  - people volume
