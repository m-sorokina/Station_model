**Short Description:**  
This application simulates a station model that can handle two types of vehicles:
 - Truck
 - Bus
  
It also manages two types of events:
 - Arrival
 - Departure
  
Vehicles and events are added randomly during the simulation.  
If the station has no available capacity to accept a given vehicle, that vehicle is skipped.  
The program stops when all station capacities are exhausted or all vehicles are currently in use.
